project 01
=============

a project in creating responsive websites by using first zurb foundation and then twitter bootstrap.

I was inspired by http://misterjekyll.be/ (the basic three-column split for main content, simple background with no pattern)

and http://foundation.zurb.com/case-sypris.php (the simple header, a big section of images on the page, and again the three-column split for main content).
